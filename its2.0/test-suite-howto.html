        <h1><span>Test Suite How-To Guide</span></h1>

        <p><span>The ITS 2.0 test suite is located at the following address <a href="https://github.com/w3c/its-2.0-testsuite">https://github.com/w3c/its-2.0-testsuite</a>. There are four main parts to the ITS 2.0 test suite which are:</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li><span><a href="#1">Conformance testing for HTML &amp; XML</a></span></li>
            <li><span><a href="#2">Testing for NIF</a></span></li>
            <li><span><a href="#3">Input file validation</a></span></li>
            <li><span><a href="#4">XLIFF samples</a></span></li>
        </ol>

        <h2><span><a name="1"></a>1. Conformance testing for HTML &amp; XML</span></h2>

        <p><span>This conformance testing is used to determine whether ITS 2.0 implementations meet the
                ITS 2.0 specification standard. The test suite has a set of test documents for both XML and
                HTML which are then used to validate the different ITS 2.0 constructs available for each
                data category. There are a total of 225 test files spread across all 19 data categories for
                both HTML and XML.</span></p>

        <h3><span>1.1 What is Conformance testing? </span></h3>  
         <p><span>Conformance testing is a type of testing where a system has to meet some specified standard.  
         In the case of ITS 2.0 this standard is dictated by the W3C standards document http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/.
         To test for compliance a series of tests have been developed externally by TCD. The specification states that 
         there are 4 different types of conformance which have to be tested for and more details on this can be found 
         at the following address <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its20">http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/#conformance</a>. </span></p>
        
	<h3><span>1.2 Details of the conformance tests </span></h3>  
         <p><span>The test suite is used to test user implementations conformance to the ITS 2.0 standard. The test suite has a set of test documents for both XML and HTML which are then used to validate the different ITS 2.0 constructs available for each data category. The ITS 2.0 test suite has 225 input test files which have been created for the 19 data categories. There are 136 XML input files and 89 HTML input files. All of these files have been validated successfully against the schemas for ITS 2.0. Section 4 of this document provides more information on how to validate XML files and validate HTML files. 
For the conformance testing, each test file in the test suite requires at least two implementations in order to be allowed into the ITS 2.0 standard. This is in line with the conformance clauses which can be found at the following address <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-spec/">http://www.w3.org/TR/qaframe-spec/</a>.  The requirement of two implementations per test suite file helps in catching errors in the standard along with making sure implementers are using the standard correctly. 
 </span></p>
 
 	<h3><span>1.3 Outcome of conformance tests </span></h3>  
 	<p><span>
 	The detailed breakdown of the conformance testing results and of systems which are certified in complying with the ITS 2.0 standard can be found in the test suite implementation report. This report is located at the following address <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/multilingualweb/lt/drafts/its20/its20-implementation-report.html">http://www.w3.org/International/multilingualweb/lt/drafts/its20/its20-implementation-report.html</a>.

        <h3><span>1.4 How to use the test suite?</span></h3>
      <p><img height="301" src="testsuite-visualization.png" width="483" alt="test suite output format" />
            <br/>
            <span><b>Figure 1: Testsuite processing &#09;Input to Output</b></span></p>

        <p><span>The validation of the input files is done through processing the input file so that it outputs a file to match a corresponding gold standard output file. The gold standard was developed to be easy to understand and implement for conformance testers. The gold standard output format was developed by the ITS 2.0 working group. Figure 1 above describes the test suite files process. The ITS 2.0 test suite input files are located at the following address <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/conformance-checkers/html-its">https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/conformance-checkers/html-its</a>.</span></p>

        <h3><span>1.4 Gold Standard output specifications details:</span></h3>

        <p><span>&#09;The gold standard output files have the following characteristics:</span></p>

                    the content within script elements in HTML)</span></li>

            <li><span>The output has to be tab-delimited

            <li><span>The attributes within elements have

        <h3><span>1.6 How gold standard output is compared to implementers output?</span></h3>
        <p><span>The conformance test output of a proposed ITS2.0 implementation is located in the folder</span>
            <span>its-2.0-testsuite/its2.0/</span><span class="c4 c8 c6">outputimplementors</span>.
            <span>This</span><span class="c4 c6">&#09;</span><span>can be tested against the gold
                standard output files located in the</span>
            <span class="c4 c6">its-2.0-testsuite/its2.0/expected</span>
            <span>folder. This can be done simply through performing a diff of the implementation’s output files and the corresponding gold standard output files. 
            To automate this process for implementers a test suite dashboard was created which supports the following tasks :</span></p>

        <ol>

        <p><span>To validate the implementers output files the test suite dashboard has to be compiled so

            <span class="c2">NIF</span><span>&#09;</span><span>&#09;</span></h2>
        
        <p>This part of the test suite is used to determine whether ITS 2.0 implementations of NIF 2.0 meet the ITS 2.0 specification standard for NIF usage. The mapping between an XML and HTML document annotated with ITS to and from NIF is not a normative part of the Its2.0 specification. The NIF test suite has a set of test documents for HTML for the 
            <span>Localisation Quality Issue</span><span class="c4">&#09;data category which is then used to validate the different aspects of ITS 2.0 and NIF against various constructs available to the Localisation Quality Issue data category. There are a total of 11 files only for HTML in the Localisation Quality Issue data category. The input files are located in the </span><span class="c4">&#09;</span>
		<span class="c4 c6">its-2.0-testsuite/its2.0/nif-conversion/input</span>
            <span class="c4">folder.</span></p>

        <p><span>The validation of the input files is done through processing the input file so that it outputs a file to match a gold standard output file. The gold standard for NIF is RDF output using the ITS 2.0 ontology. The gold standard output for NIF can be reached by following the NIF conversion algorithm discussed in the ITS 2.0 specification located </span>
            <span><a class="c15" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its20">http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/#conversion-to-nif</a></span><span
                class="c4">.</span></p>

        <h3><span>2.1 How gold standard &#09;NIF output is compared to implementers output?</span></h3>

        <p><span>The NIF output files are compared via the use of SPARQL queries done over the implementers RDF/NIF output files (.ttl). If the SPARQL queries are successful then the NIF output files are correct and meet the gold standard. The implementer’s NIF test output files are located in the its-2.0-testsuite/its2.0/nif-conversion/expected folder.</span></p>
